  Mounting the FTP Board
---

Before working with OpenPnP, we'll affix the FTP PCB to the staging plate.

1. Unscrew the M3 wingnut from each of the universal PCB fixture system.
2. Install the fixtures as shown below and secure them loosely with the wingnuts underneath the staging plate.
3. Place your FTP PCB in the fixtures and make sure it is roughly square to the staging plate and secured in place. Then, tighten down the wing nuts to keep the fixture in place. You should be able to remove the PCB by pressing on the tabs on the Fixture, and it should locate to the same place when if you insert it again. Note: you don't need to get the position perfect compared to the photos.
4. Remove the FTP PCB and apply four rows of double-sided tape in between the white lines. The tape will help test components stick to the board during the calibration process.
