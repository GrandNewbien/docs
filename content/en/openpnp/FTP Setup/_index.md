  Setting up your first job with the help of the FTP PCB
---

Now that you have your machine roughly setup in OpenPnP, it's time to actually start a placement job. This section is  written for use with the FTP PCB that is included in all LumenPnP v3 kits, and is also available for purchase separately [here](https://opulo.io/products/getting-started-kit). You can also follow these steps if you're using your own PCB, but there may be slight differences, such as where the origin of your PCB is in the imported KiCAD file.
